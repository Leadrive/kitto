# Where to get reference documentation #

All source code in KItto has comments in XMLDoc format, used to build a comprehensive reference documentation set.

You can [browse the reference online](http://www.ethea.it/docs/kitto/en/ref/index.html), or you can see the documentation directly inside Delphi's Help Insight tooltips: just hover the mouse pointer over a symbol and see its documentation.

In order to make this a better experience, we suggest that you install an enhanced style sheet for Help Insight, such as [this one from DevJET software](http://www.devjet.net/products/documentation-insight/more-help-insight-customization/).

The reference documentation is constantly being updated, so please check back often and [report](http://code.google.com/p/kitto/issues/list) any missing or wrong pieces as you find them.
