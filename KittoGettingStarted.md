# Getting started with Kitto #

Currently Kitto requires Delphi XE3 or later. The first thing you need to do is setup your development/testing environment. Follow the instructions here:

  * [Configuring Delphi](KittoConfigurationDelphi.md)
  * [Configuring the Web Server](KittoConfigurationApache.md)

Then you are encouraged to try one of Kitto's built-in examples:

  * [HelloKitto](HelloKitto.md)
  * [TasKitto](TasKitto.md)

Both need a database, which can be [Firebird](http://www.firebirdsql.com/) for both. HelloKitto is also ready for Microsoft SQL Server. If you are feeling adventurous, you could try to use a different database by manually adapting the provided scripts (if you do that, definately send through the fruits of your work so everyone benefits), but we suggest that you start with the unchanged examples in order to minimize troubles.

Assuming you have you environment set up correctly, you just need to open an example's project, compile and run it, then navigate to it in a browser.

After looking at the examples, or before doing that if you like it better, you can dive in beginning with Kitto's [basic concepts](BasicConcepts.md).

Happy Kittoing!
