# DataPanelLeaf #

It is a base class for data panels that display record data in a [List](List.md) or [Form](Form.md) controller. Delphi developers might think of them as more or less data-aware controllers. Among the controllers inherited from this one are the [GridPanel](GridPanel.md) and the [ChartPanel](ChartPanel.md).

This is an abstract class (called TKExtDataPanelLeafController) that you are never going to use directly. You use the inherited classes instead.

The DataPanelLeaf is a [Panel](Panel.md), and as such it inherits all the features that are common to all panels.
